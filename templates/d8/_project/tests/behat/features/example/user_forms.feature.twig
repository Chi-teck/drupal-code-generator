Feature: User forms
  I need to be able to use the most common areas of the site.

  @javascript
  Scenario: Registration
    Given I am on "/user/register"
    Then I should see "Create new account" in the "content" region
    Then I fill in "Email address" with "test@example.com"
    And I fill in "Username" with "test"
    And I press "Create new account"
    Then I should see the message "Thank you for applying for an account."
